Court of Appealsâ€™ contrary opinion reversed, post-conviction court judgment ordering new trial affirmed. \n\nDefendant was accused of murdering the victim with a firearm. The defense theory was that another man, Baines, was the actual murderer.

That expertâ€™s qualifications were discussed during a pre-trial hearing, but the defense did not call him to testify. \n\nThe post-conviction court held that the defense expert raised a doubt about defendantâ€™s guilt and there was no reason not to call the expert, and therefore it was ineffective not to do so. The court further found that the error was harmful. \n\nThe Court of Appeals reversed, reasoning that a reasonable attorney could have chosen not to call the expert, and that counsel has acted reasonably in hiring experts and investigating the ballistics issue. The dissent argued that the choice to investigate and the choice to call a witness were separate, and that failing to call the witness was unreasonable. \n\nIn concluding that trial counsel had acted unreasonably, the Supreme Court observed that the post-conviction court found that trial counsel had misunderstood the helpfulness of the defense expertâ€™s testimony.

Defendant issued a subpoena, directed to Google, for the victimâ€™s search history. \n\nGoogle declined to provide responsive data, citing the federal Stored Communications Act (\"SCA\"). The SCA prohibits providers of remote computer services, such as Google, from divulging information. The statute contains exceptions for legal processes such as warrants and subpoenas issued by government entities.\n\nFollowing Googleâ€™s refusal, defendant sought an order compelling the state to seek information from Google. The court found that the requested information was potentially exculpatory and directed the state to try to obtain it.\n\nThe state issued a subpoena, which Google declined to honor. Google took the position that a warrant was required. The state thereafter took the position that it could not make the averments necessary for a search warrant. \n\nDefendant moved to dismiss based on the stateâ€™s failure to seek a search warrant. The court denied the motion, reasoning that it could not force the state to make the averments that would support a search warrant and that the evidence, while â€œimportant and exculpatory,â€ was not the â€œheart of the case.â€ Further, the court explained, the victim would testify about the Google searches, and that testimony was probably more important than the actual Google data. \n\nThe Supreme Court held that the trial courtâ€™s initial ruling was not before it. It upheld the second ruling, failing to require the state to obtain the data, because data held by Google was not in the stateâ€™s control and because, on the facts of this case, the evidence was not central to the defense such that there was a Constitutional right to obtain it. \n\nFor similar reasons, the trial court had not erred in failing to dismiss, notwithstanding the prosecutorâ€™s defiance of the courtâ€™s orders; the defendant did not demonstrate either that the data could have been obtained if the prosecutor had acted promptly, or that the evidence would not be available on remand.\n\nDefendant issued a subpoena for the victimâ€™s computer or for a copy of its hard drive.

Conviction reversed, remanded for new trial.\n\nIn order to satisfy the particularity requirement of Article I, section 9, a warrant to search a computer must specify the data sought, including, if possible, the time within which it was created or accessed. Information obtained during a computer search that is outside the scope of the warrant is inadmissible unless an exception to the warrant requirement applies. \n\nDefendant was convicted of murdering his infant son. He told the police that his son had struggled to breathe and he had looked online for first aid advice before calling 911. The state had probable cause to examine the computer for evidence of defendant search for first-aid advice. It obtained a warrant, examined the computer, and properly offered evidence at trial of the defendantâ€™s searches made shortly before the 911 call. But the forensic examination also revealed that defendant had searched for information about child abuse at other times, and that evidence was also admitted. The admission of the child-abuse searches was error, because no probable cause or search-warrant exception supported a search for that evidence, and was not harmless. \n\nThe court examined decisions from other jurisdictions and secondary sources and explained that, because of how computers store data, an expert search for specific data could easily reveal other data, and the rule announced was necessary to avoid permitting a general warrant.

He reentered the United States, was arrested by ICE in 2014, and sought post-conviction relief. He sought to avoid the two-year statute of limitations based on allegations that he was illiterate, spoke little English, and had no practical way to learn about post-conviction procedures or file for post-conviction relief while in Mexico. The court rejected his argument, explaining that the post-conviction statute was tolled only if information necessary to a late-filed petition was not â€œavailable.â€ Because information about post-conviction was available regardless of petitionerâ€™s personal circumstances, the statute of limitations was not tolled and the petition was untimely.

Under the statutes in effect at the time, the Board of Parole had the authority to parole people serving sentences for aggravated murder, but not murder, and therefore defendantâ€™s sentence was a â€œtrue lifeâ€ sentence. In 1999, the Court of Appeals found that the sentence for murder was constitutionally disproportionate and reduced one such sentence to 25 years in prison followed by lifetime supervision. In 1999, the legislature amended the pertinent statutes to permit the Board of Parole to parole those convicted of murder without regard for the date of the crime. \n\nDefendant argued that his judgment of conviction contained an erroneous term of life in prison.

The court reasoned that the stateâ€™s purpose for the evidence required a character-based inference, and therefore the evidence was inadmissible character evidence.\r\n\r\nThe court did not consider whether the evidence was admissible under OEC 404(4) (regarding propensity evidence in a child-sex-abuse case) because the state did not make that argument below.\r\n\r\nAlthough there was no direct evidence of sexual intent, the court concluded that a rational juror could find sexual intent and therefore the trial court did not err in denying defendantâ€™s MJOA.\r\n\r\nThe case was remanded for new trial.','A157318','290 Or App 244','',2,14,2018,'http://www.publications.ojd.state.or.us/docs/A157318.pdf','2022-02-01 11:39:23','https://libraryofdefense.ocdla.org/Blog:Case_Reviews/Oregon_Appellate_Court--February_14,_2018',0,0),(199,0,'State v.

After killing her, he drove to Mississippi, believing that he heard the victimâ€™s voice on the radio and that radio stations were talking to him. In Mississippi, he confessed to the murder.\r\n\r\nA defense expert testified at trial that the defendant had â€œprobable amphetamine-induced psychotic disorder with delusions and hallucinationsâ€ at the time of the killing. The expert distinguished the diagnosis from drug dependence. The expert said that, when he evaluated the defendant, the defendant did not show signs of psychosis.\r\n\r\nThe defense expert said that defendant was a heavy user of methamphetamine and had consumed a gram of methamphetamine in the 12 hours leading up to the victimâ€™s death.\r\n\r\nA stateâ€™s expert opined that the defendant was suffering from â€œa methamphetamine-induced psychotic disorder based upon his voluntary use of that drugâ€ at the time of the killing but lacked any brain defect, lingering psychosis or long-term mental disorder. The state\'s expert also said that drug-induced psychosis is transient and only present when the drug is present.\r\n\r\nThe trial court gave instructions on voluntary intoxication, diminished capacity, and guilty except for insanity. The trial court also instructed the jury that â€œ[d]rug use, drug dependence, and drug-induced psychoses are not mental diseases or defects as the term mental disease or defect is used in these instructions.â€\r\n\r\nThe court considered legislative history to determine that temporary substance-induced psychosis was a â€œpersonality disorderâ€ as that term is used in ORS 161.295, and, therefore, it is not a mental disease or defect. Accordingly, the court affirmed the conviction and sentence.\r\n\r\nThe court reversed the portion of the judgment that required the defendant to pay costs for his extradition.

The state sought to offer evidence that the defendant had previously called 911, in support of its argument that the defendant was paranoid and therefore he did not act reasonably in self-defense. The trial court admitted the evidence, but the Court of Appeals reversed. An element of a self-defense claim is an objectively-reasonable belief that the use of force is warranted.

The trial court reasoned that, because father was serving a thirty-year prison term, DHS would be unable to take any steps to reunify Z and father.

The Supreme Court ultimately held that the prosecutor could not use a plea bargain to prevent a witness from testifying truthfully, and that OEC 513 did not exclude evidence of such a plea bargain.\n\nThe Supreme Court discussed the procedure in the trial court and the defendant\'s arguments and requests in part of it discussion of preservation. \n\nIn holding that the defendant\'s Oregon right to compulsory process had been violated, the court held that defendant did not need to show that the witness would have testified in the absence of contrary pressure from the state, or that the resulting testimony would have been favorable. The court observed that the plea agreement here would prevent the witness from cooperating with any pretrial investigation or inquiry by the defendant, frustrating an attempt to carry any such burden. \n\nThe court held that, under the facts of the case, the error was harmful. The court left it to the trial court to determine how to proceed on remand.\n','S066636','367 Or 1','Clackamas County',9,3,2020,'https://link.ocdla.org/soll/S066636','2022-02-01 11:39:23','https://libraryofdefense.ocdla.org/Blog:Case_Reviews/Oregon_Supreme_Court,_September_3,_2020',0,0),(497,0,'State v.

In response to a cross-examination question, C said that defendant had taken a picture of a mole in case it turned out to be cancer. The state also played a recording of an interview with defendant when he gave innocent explanations for the pictures. The state asked the court to admit evidence of the hidden camera to show defendant\'s sexual purpose, and the trial court agreed, as did the Court of Appeals.\n\nDuring the defense case, the defense offered evidence that police had failed to investigate thoroughly. In response, the state offered evidence that there had been other victims captured by the hidden camera and had followed up with them. The court admitted the evidence, reasoning that the defendant had opened the door, and the Court of Appeals found no error.\n','A160031','302 Or App 655','Washington County',3,11,2020,'https://link.ocdla.org/soll/A160031','2022-02-01 11:39:23','https://libraryofdefense.ocdla.org/Blog:Case_Reviews/Oregon_Appellate_Court,_March_11,_2020',0,0),(582,0,'State v.

Reversed.\r\n\r\nThe arrest was based on a probation-violation warrant issued after probation ended, and thus was unlawful.

Reversed.\r\n\r\nDefendant did not object at trial, but thereafter filed a written objection to the verdict. In finding that preservation was excused, the Court of Appeals noted that the trial court\'s erroneous ruling was unanticipated, there was no obvious mechanism for defendant\'s objections, and that the state was not prejudiced by the late objection.','A169671','317 Or App 19','Polk',1,12,2022,'https://link.ocdla.org/soll/A169671','2022-02-01 11:39:23',NULL,0,0),(1024,2,'State v.

The proponent failed to prove that the other business\'s records satisfied the requirements of the business-records exception. The trial court and Court of Appeals held that records could become admissible business records if they were adopted as business records, but the Supreme Court rejected that approach as inconsistent with the plain text of the rule. \r\n\r\nThe court observed that a \"duty to report\" on the part of the declarant does not satisfy the requirements of the rule. \r\n\r\nGarrett, dissenting, would have held that a business that has records in its files can offer them as business records regardless of whether the records were generated by another entity. The dissent noted that the rule adopted in this case is the minority rule in the United States.
